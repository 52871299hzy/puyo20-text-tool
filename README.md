# miscstuff
Miscellaneous stuff for translating Wii game Puyo Puyo 20th anniversary.
It's mainly based on [nickworonekin/puyo-text-editor](//github.com/nickworonekin/puyo-text-editor).

`mtxdecoder.cpp` decodes MTX file into json.
`a.py` deals with image stuff.
`fntmaker.cpp` actually makes both the FNT file and MTX file from json ~~(I wrote a crappy implemention to decode json)~~.
